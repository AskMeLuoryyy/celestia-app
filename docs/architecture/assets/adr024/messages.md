# PBBT Messages and Validation Logic

At a high level, all flavors of PBBT have four message types. `Commitment`,
`Have`, `Want`, and `Data`.

## Commitment

```protobuf=
message TxMetaData {
  repeated bytes hash  = 1;
  uint32 start = 2;
  uint32 end   = 3;
}

// CompactBlock commits to the transaction included in a proposal.
message CompactBlock {
  int64                 height    = 1;
  int32                 round     = 2;
  bytes                 bp_hash   = 3;
  repeated BlobMetaData blobs     = 4;
  bytes                 signature = 5;
}
```

The compact block is signed over by the proposer, and verified by converting to
signbytes, and using the proposer's public key to verify the included signature.

> Note: This siganture is separate from the proposal signature as it is purely
> related to block propagation, and not meant to be part of the proposal. This
> allows for block propagation to be backwards compatible with older
> implementations.

The `TxMetaData` contains the hash of the PFB for the blob transaction that it
commits to, alongside the `start` and `end`. `start` is the inclusive index of
the starting byte in the protobuf encoded block. `end` depicts the last byte
occupied by the blob transaction.

The `pbbt_root` is generated by taking the merkle root over of each of the blob
transactions in `BlobMetaData` and `Have` messasges.

Verification:

- The signature MUST be valid and from the expected proposer for that height and
  round

## Have

```protobuf=
message HavePart {
  bytes                   hash   = 1;
  int64                   height = 2;
  int32                   round  = 3;
  tendermint.crypto.Proof proof  = 4 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}

```

Verification:
- The merkle proof must be verified using the `pbbt_root` in the `CompactBlock` for that height and round.

### Want

```protobuf
message WantParts {
  tendermint.libs.bits.BitArray parts  = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  int64                         height = 2;
  int32                         round  = 3;
}
```

## Data

```protobuf
message Part {
  int64  height = 1;
  int32  round  = 2;
  uint32 index  = 3;
  bytes  data   = 4;
}
```

Verification
- The hash of the bytes in the data field MUST match that of the `Have` message.
